WFSCollider V1.0 OSC specification

/wfscollider/source/set index type x y level
	set all parameters of source
	index[int]: (0...7) - which of the 8 inputs to address
	type[string]: either "plane" or "point".
	x[float]: x coordinate in meters
	y[float]: y coordinate in meters
	level[float]: level value in range [0,1]
	
	If the source is of different type then the "type" then it will switch from point to plane or vice-versa.
	
/wfscollider/source/mute index on_off
	activates/deactivates (mutes) source
	index[int]: (0...7) - which of the 8 inputs to address
	on_off[int]: [0,1] - 1 mutes, 0 umutes source	
	
/wfscollider/source/level index value
	set level
	index[int]: (0...7) - which of the 8 inputs to address
	value[float]: level value in range [0,1] 
	
/wfscollider/source/position index x y
	set position
	index[int]: (0...7) - which of the 8 inputs to address
	x[float]: x in meters (point source) or ang in degrees (plane wave).
	y[float]: y in meters (point source) or dist in meters (plane wave).
	
/wfscollider/source/position_polar index ang dist
	set position
	index[int]: (0...7) - which of the 8 inputs to address
	ang[float]: angle in degrees [0,360].
	dist[float]: distance in meters. 
	
/wfscollider/source/type index type
	set type.
	index[int]: (0...7) - which of the 8 inputs to address
	type[string]: either "plane" or "point".
	
/wfscollider/all …list	
	
/wfscollider/level value
	value[float]: global level in range [0,1]
	
/wfscollider/eq/low/freq value
	value[float]: frequency in range [50,1000]
/wfscollider/eq/low/gain value
	value[float]: gain in range [0,1]
/wfscollider/eq/mid/freq value
	value[float]: frequency in range [167,6000]
/wfscollider/eq/mid/gain value
	value[float]: gain in range [0,1]
/wfscollider/eq/mid/q value
	value[float]: q in range [0.1,10]
/wfscollider/eq/high/freq value
	value[float]: frequency in range [1000,10289]
/wfscollider/eq/high/gain value
	value[float]: gain in range [0,1]
	
/wfscollider/stop
	stops live mode
	
/wfscollider/start
	start live mode
	
	
==Queries==
	
/wfscollider/info/source index
	send information on the state of source at index. Will output:
	/wfscollider/info/source index type loc1 loc2 level on_off
	
/wfscollider/info/all
	sends information for all sources
	
	
	NOTE: plane waves should not be moved during perfomance, since this might result in artifacts. movement should 	only be done to find a good position for the plane wave source, and then the source should be left at that 	position during the performance.
 
 
 - When switching from plane wave source to point source the synth is freed with fade out and a new synth is created immediately
 - When the live system is booted all 8 sources will be unpaused and set to point sources.
 

Examples

- set source number 3 to x= 3 y=2

/wfscollider/source/set 2 point 3 2

- change source 3 from point to plane at 30º and 5 meters distance

/wfscollider/source/set 2 plane 30 5

- mute source 3

/wfscollider/source/mute 3 1
